Installing calc from the bzip2-ed tarball in 4 easy steps:

    0)  If your platform supports i686 RPMs, you may want to go to:

	    http://www.isthe.com/chongo/src/calc/

	and use these RPMs:

	    * calc*.i686.rpm
		- all that is needed if you just want to use calc

	    * calc-devel-*.i686.rpm
	        - calc *.h header and *.a lib files for use in other programs

	    * calc.*.src.rpm
	        - calc source in RPM package form

	The following 4 steps apply to calc source tree that comes from either:

		bunzip2 -c calc-*.tar.bz2 | tar -xvf -

	or from:

		rpm -ivh calc-*.src.rpm
		cd /var/tmp
		bunzip2 -c /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES/calc-*.tar.bz2 | tar -xvf -

    1)	Look at the makefile, and adjust it to suit your needs.

	The top level Makefile and the custom/Makefile require a GNU
	Make (such as gmake) or an equivalently advanced make.	On many
	targets, the default make is sufficent.  On FreeBSD for example,
	one must use gmake instead of make.

	If your target system does not have GNU Make (or equivalent), then
	you should try using the Makefile.simple and custom/Makefile.simple
	files:

	    mv Makefile Makefile.gmake
	    cp Makefile.simple Makefile
	    mv custom/Makefile custom/Makefile.gmake
	    cp custom/Makefile.simple custom/Makefile

	The Makefile, as shipped, is suitable for installation under
	Linux and Un*x-like environments.  For the most part, the default
	values should work.  If in doubt, follow the 'When in doubt'
	suggestion.

	!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
	! If you are building under Windoz or a Windoz-like environment !
	! (such as Cygwin or DJGPP), read the README.WINDOWS file.      !
	!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

	You should determine if these Makefile variables are reasonable:

	    INCDIR		Where the system include (.h) files are kept.
	    BINDIR		Where to install calc binary files.
	    LIBDIR		Where to install calc link library (*.a) files.
	    CALC_SHAREDIR	Where to install calc help, .cal, startup, and
	    			config files.

	You may want to change the default installation locations for
	these values, which are based on the 4 values listed above:

	    HELPDIR            where the help directory is installed
	    CALC_INCDIR        where the calc include files are installed
	    CUSTOMCALDIR       where custom *.cal files are installed
	    CUSTOMHELPDIR      where custom help files are installed
	    CUSTOMINCDIR       where custom .h files are installed
	    SCRIPTDIR          where calc shell scripts are installed

	If you want to install calc files under a top level directory,
	then set the T value:

	    The calc install is performed under ${T}, the calc build is
	    performed under /.	The purpose for ${T} is to allow someone
	    to install calc somewhere other than into the system area.

	    For example, if:

	    	BINDIR= /usr/bin
		LIBDIR= /usr/lib
		CALC_SHAREDIR= /usr/share/calc

	    and if:

	    	T= /var/tmp/testing

	    Then the installation locations will be:

		calc binary files:	/var/tmp/testing/usr/bin
		calc link library:	/var/tmp/testing/usr/lib
		calc help, .cal ...:	/var/tmp/testing/usr/share/calc
		... etc ...		/var/tmp/testing/...

	    If ${T} is empty, calc is installed under /, which is the same
	    top of tree for which it was built.  If ${T} is non-empty, then
	    calc is installed under ${T}, as if one had to chroot under
	    ${T} for calc to operate.

	Look for the section that starts:

	    ################
	    # compiler set #
	    ################

	    Select a compiler set by commenting in the appropriate set
	    of cc options.  As shipped the Makefile assumes a gcc-like
	    environment such as Linux.  If a more appropriate cc set if
	    found below, comment out the Linux set and comment in that
	    set or edit the gcc set or the common cc set as needed.

	You may want to change these Makrfile variables from their defaults:

	    RANLIB

		You may or may not need RANLIB when building libraries.
		As shipped the Makefile assumes RANLIB is needed.
		Comment the in/out the RANLIB value if ranlib does
		not work or does not exist.

	    CALCPAGER

		You may want to change the default pager used by calc.
		As shipped the Makefile assumes 'more'.  On your system
		you may find 'less' to be a better pager.

	    DEBUG

	       Some compilers (to put it mildly) have bugs.  Sometimes the
	       DEBUG Makefile variable causes the compiler / optimizer to
	       produce bad code.  Other compilers do just fine.

	       If possible try to use DEBUG=-O3 -g3 (maximum optimization
	       and debug symbols).  If the calc test fails (see step 3),
	       try lowering either the -O value and/or the -g3.  Also try
	       using -Osomething without -g.

	   Adjust other Makefile variables as needed.

    2)	build calc:

	The top level Makefile and the custom/Makefile require a GNU
	Make (such as gmake) or an equivalently advanced make.	On many
	targets, the default make is sufficent.  On FreeBSD for example,
	one must use gmake instead of make.

	If your target system does not have GNU Make (or equivalent), then
	you should try using the Makefile.simple and custom/Makefile.simple
	files:

	    mv Makefile Makefile.gmake
	    cp Makefile.simple Makefile
	    mv custom/Makefile custom/Makefile.gmake
	    cp custom/Makefile.simple custom/Makefile

	make all

	==> We are interested in any compiler warnings (and errors) that
	    you may find.  See the BUGS file if you find any compiler
	    warning or errors.

	NOTE: You can force calc to build with only static libs:

		make clobber
		make calc-static-only BLD_TYPE=calc-static-only

	      or force calc to build with only dynamic libs:

		make clobber
		make calc-dynamic-only BLD_TYPE=calc-dynamic-only

    3)	test calc:

	make check

	==> If you run into problems, read the BUGS file and follow
	    the instructions found in there.

	NOTE: For a quiet check which only prints if something goes wrong:

		make chk

    4)	install calc:

	make install

We suggest that you might want to read the README.FIRST file and look at
the calc help subsystem.  See also the README.md file.
