Dear calc user on a Windoz based system,

See the HOWTO.INSTALL file for information on how to build and install calc.
See also the README file.

NOTE: The main developers do not have access to a Windoz based platform.
      While we will make an effort to not break calc Windoz based system,
      our lack of a Windoz test environment will mean we will make mistakes
      from time to time.  Hopefully Windowz users can overcome these mistakes.
      Of course you are welcome to send us any patches that fix your
      Windoz build environment.

=-= compiling with Cygwin =-=
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

An effort is being made to allow windows users to compile calc using the
Cygwin project (http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/) with the GCC compiler
and Un*x tools for Windows.

The major porting work for Cygwin was performed by Thomas Jones-Low
(tjoneslo at softstart dot com).

In March 2009, Michael Penk (mpenk at wuska dot com) reported success in
installs under Cygwin:

    On my fairly complete Cygwin installs, everything compiles,
    checks, and installs correctly.  My Cygwin is configured
    in a very standard way (out of the box, using all of Cygwin's
    defaults).  The install worked on 5 different machines with
    Cygwin on them: one XP home, one XP professional, and three
    Vista professionals.

Using the calc Makefile, he did the following:

    make all target=Cygwin
    make check
    make install

He also reports:

    Of course, one should be logged in as an Administrator when
    one builds and installs calc.

He was compiling calc 2.12.4.0 with Cygwin version 1.5.25-15.

Much earlier (2001?) Thomas Jones-Low (tjoneslo at softstart dot com)
recommended that you generate by hand all of the header files that
by the Makefile.  This has been done for you via the makefile rule:

	make win32_hsrc

which uses the Makefile variables in win32.mkdef to form these header
files under win32 directory.

You will find generated versions of these files located in the win32
sub-directory.  These files may be appropriate for your Cygwin building
needs.

In particular:

	Just copy the win32/*.[ch] files up into the top level calc
	source directory, edit them (if needed) and build using the
	Cygwin GCC compiler and Cygwin build environment.

=-= compiling under DJGPP =-=
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

You might want to try using the DJGPP system to compile calc.  See:

	http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/

for DJGPP details and availability.

To compile with DJGPP, one needs to select a number of Makefile
variable changes.  Eli Zaretskii <eliz at is dot elta dot co dot il>
recommends the following settings:

	TERMCONTROL= -DUSE_TERMIOS
	BYTE_ORDER= -DLITTLE_ENDIAN
	LONG_BITS= 32
	HAVE_FPOS_POS= -DHAVE_NO_FPOS_POS
	FPOS_BITS= 32
	OFF_T_BITS= 32
	DEV_BITS= 32
	INODE_BITS= 32
	HAVE_USTAT= -DHAVE_NO_USTAT
	HAVE_GETSID= -DHAVE_NO_GETSID
	HAVE_GETPGID= -DHAVE_NO_GETPGID
	HAVE_GETTIME= -DHAVE_NO_GETTIME
	HAVE_GETPRID= -DHAVE_NO_GETPRID
	HAVE_URANDOM_H= NO
	ALIGN32= -UMUST_ALIGN32
	HAVE_MALLOC_H= YES
	HAVE_STDLIB_H= YES
	HAVE_STRING_H= YES
	HAVE_TIMES_H= NO
	HAVE_SYS_TIMES_H= YES
	HAVE_TIME_H= YES
	HAVE_SYS_TIME_H= YES
	HAVE_UNISTD_H= YES
	BINDIR= /dev/env/DJDIR/bin
	INCDIR= /dev/env/DJDIR/include
	LIBDIR= /dev/env/DJDIR/lib
	MANDIR= /dev/env/DJDIR/man/man1
	CATDIR= /dev/env/DJDIR/man/cat1
	NROFF= groff
	CALCPATH= .;./cal;~/.cal;${CALC_SHAREDIR};${CUSTOMCALDIR}
	CALCRC= ${CALC_SHAREDIR}/startup;~/.calcrc;./.calcinit
	CALCPAGER= less.exe -ci
	DEBUG= -O2 -gstabs+ -DWINDOZ

The 'Linux set' or 'gcc set' (see the Select your compiler type section)
should work for DJGPP systems if you set the above Makefile variables.

Look for Makefile comments of the form:

	# Select ...something... for DJGPP.

Follow those recommendations.  In cases where they conflict with
the above Makefile list, follow the recommendation in the Makefile.
