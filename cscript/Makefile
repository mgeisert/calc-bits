# Normally, the upper level makefile will set these values.  We provide
# a default here just in case you want to build from this directory.

# Normally certain files depend on the Makefile.  If the Makefile is
# changed, then certain steps should be redone.  If MAKE_FILE is
# set to Makefile, then these files will depend on Makefile.  If
# MAKE_FILE is empty, then they wont.
#
# If in doubt, set MAKE_FILE to Makefile
#
MAKE_FILE= Makefile

# Controlling file makefile basename (without the path)
#
# This is the basename same of the makefile that may/does/will drive
# this makefile.

# For DJGPP, select:

# where to install calc realted things
#
# ${BINDIR}		where to install calc binary files
# ${LIBDIR}		where calc link library (*.a) files are installed
# ${CALC_SHAREDIR}	where to install calc help, .cal, startup, config files
#
# NOTE: The install rule prepends installation paths with ${T}, which
#	by default is empty.  If ${T} is non-empty, then installation
#	locations will be relative to the ${T} directory.
#
# For DJGPP, select:
#
#	BINDIR= /dev/env/DJDIR/bin
#	LIBDIR= /dev/env/DJDIR/lib
#	CALC_SHAREDIR= /dev/env/DJDIR/share/calc
#
# If in doubt, set:
#
#	BINDIR= /usr/bin
#	LIBDIR= /usr/lib
#	CALC_SHAREDIR= /usr/share/calc
#
#BINDIR= /usr/local/bin
#BINDIR= /dev/env/DJDIR/bin
BINDIR= /usr/bin

#LIBDIR= /usr/local/lib
#LIBDIR= /dev/env/DJDIR/lib
LIBDIR= /usr/lib

#CALC_SHAREDIR= /usr/local/lib/calc

# ---------------------------------------------------------------
# ${HELPDIR}		where the help directory is installed
# ${CALC_INCDIR}	where the calc include files are installed
# ${SCRIPTDIR}		where calc shell scripts are installed
#
# NOTE: The install rule prepends installation paths with ${T}, which
#	by default is empty.  If ${T} is non-empty, then installation
#	locations will be relative to the ${T} directory.
#
# If in doubt, set:
#
#	HELPDIR= ${CALC_SHAREDIR}/help
#	CALC_INCDIR= ${INCDIR}/calc
#	SCRIPTDIR= ${BINDIR}/cscript
#
HELPDIR= ${CALC_SHAREDIR}/help
CALC_INCDIR= ${INCDIR}/calc
SCRIPTDIR= ${BINDIR}/cscript

# T - top level directory under which calc will be installed
#
# The calc install is performed under ${T}, the calc build is
# performed under /.	The purpose for ${T} is to allow someone
# to install calc somewhere other than into the system area.
#
# For example, if:
#
#     BINDIR= /usr/bin
#     LIBDIR= /usr/lib
#     CALC_SHAREDIR= /usr/share/calc
#
# and if:
#
#     T= /var/tmp/testing
#
# Then the installation locations will be:
#
#     calc binary files:	/var/tmp/testing/usr/bin
#     calc link library:	/var/tmp/testing/usr/lib
#     calc help, .cal ...:	/var/tmp/testing/usr/share/calc
#     ... etc ...		/var/tmp/testing/...
#
# If ${T} is empty, calc is installed under /, which is the same
# top of tree for which it was built.  If ${T} is non-empty, then
# calc is installed under ${T}, as if one had to chroot under
# ${T} for calc to operate.

# The ${SCRIPT} list is the list of calc shell script files (without the .calc
# extension) which will be installed.
#
# The ${SCRIPT_SRC} is built from ${SCRIPT} and has the .calc extensions.
#
# This list is produced by the detaillist rule when no WARNINGS are detected.
# To add a script:
#
#	1) Name the file with a .calc filename extension
#	2) Place that file under RCS control
#	3) Add the name, without the .calc extension to the ${SCRIPT} below
#	4) Write out this Makefile
#	5) Replace the ${SCRIPT} and ${SCRIPT_SRC} lines with the output of:
